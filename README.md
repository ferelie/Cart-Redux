# Cart-Redux

## I made this small app while learning react-redux. Feel free to try it as a live demo here: https://ferelie.github.io/Cart-Redux/

* You can add products to the cart by clicking "Add to cart" button next to each item.
* You can toggle-view and modify the items in your cart by clicking on the Cart button on the top right.
